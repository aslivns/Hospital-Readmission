       " The problem of readmissions to the hospital is receiving increased attention as a potential way to address problems in quality of care, cost of care, and care transitions.<sup>1,2</sup>  Medicare reports 30-day hospital readmissions for acute myocardial infarction, congestive failure, and pneumonia for individual hospitals across the country.<sup>3</sup>   Interventions are underway to reduce hospital readmissions at the state and national level.<sup>4,5</sup>\n",
       " <br> <br>\n",
       " Prior research reports have focused on readmissions for specific conditions such as congestive heart failure, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and psychoses.<sup>6,7,8</sup>  This Statistical Brief provides an overview of 30-day all-payer, all-cause readmissions to U.S. hospitals for a range of conditions in 2010, thereby presenting the most comprehensive national estimates on readmissions by condition.\n",
       " \n",
       "   <br/><br/>\n",
       " In this Statistical Brief, <em>readmission</em> was defined as a subsequent hospital admission within 30 days following an original admission (or index stay) that occurred from January through November 2010.  All-cause readmissions were examined; thus, readmissions may or may not include conditions that were listed as the principal diagnosis during the index stay.  Readmissions were tracked across the same or different hospitals.  Some readmissions may be planned or unavoidable-no attempt was made to remove these types of readmissions from the analysis.\n",
       "   <br/><br/>\n",
       " Readmission rates using Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) data are presented for the most frequently treated conditions in U.S. hospitals during 2010 and for the conditions with the highest readmission rates.  All estimates were taken from HCUPnet, the online query system that provides free access to information from HCUP.<sup>9</sup>   For a subset of conditions, readmission rates are presented by age group and expected payer (insurance status).  Patients younger than 1 year were excluded from this analysis.  Readmission rates were calculated without risk adjustment.\n",
       "   <br/><br/>\n",
       " Appendix A provides detailed information on readmission rates for most conditions treated in U.S. hospitals in 2010. The table provides information on the number of index stays for each condition, the number of all-cause readmissions within 30 days, and the percentage of index stays that were followed by a readmission within 30 days for any cause.  Excluded were nonspecific conditions and any conditions with fewer than 5,000 index stays or fewer than 500 readmissions.  Conditions are organized by etiology or body system.  \n",
